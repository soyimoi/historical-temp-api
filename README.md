API calling for any historical date and city after  1st Jan, 2010 


I created this program to help me with my temperature blanket crochet project for 2023.

A temperature blanket is a crochet or knit record of the temperature throughout a set time period (a year in this case) using temperature ranges with associated yarn colors. Typically you would take the average temperature for the day to map the color based on the chosen ranges.

But what happens when you didn't manage to crochet for the whole week and need to catch up?!

This program outputs the min, max and average temperatures for the chosen city and dates and maps them to the specified colors based on the temp ranges given. 

In this case, the program takes the average temp to map the color, but it can easily be changed to max or min.

Cheers!
